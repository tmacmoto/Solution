# Alloyed ML Challenge – Solution

This repository contains my end-to-end solution to the Alloyed AM process modelling task including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering & selection
- Model training (Random Forest, XGBoost, linear models)
- SHAP-based model interpretation
- Conclusions and process insights

All work is contained in `solution.ipynb`.

## 🔧 Environment Setup

The solution requires Python **3.9+**.  
A convenience script is provided to set up everything automatically.

### 1. Create and activate the virtual environment (this may take a few minutes)

```bash
chmod +x create_env.sh
./create_env.sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash 
jupyter notebook solution.ipynb
```
